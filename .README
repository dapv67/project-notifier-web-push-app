Web application that notifies the opening of a new project to all its users who are subscribed

Problem to solve: Delays or loss of time for the delivery of new projects due to lack of information and not knowing when the project was opened.

How did I solve it?: I generated and implemented a web application with javascript, html and css that generates alerts when a new project is opened to all network users subscribed through a service worker.

Results: The engineers know when the project started and had more information in time to avoid delays for delivery.
